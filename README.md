<p><strong>Remember to backup your database before updating to a beta version</strong></p><br />
<p><strong>Updating instructions from 1.17 -> 1.18: https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=2371063&postcount=841</strong><p>
<p><strong>Updating instructions from 1.18 -> 1.19: download the new skillgroups.cfg and replace the old one in addons/sourcemod/configs. </br>
If you want to keep your old titles then you'll have to manually copy over the old ones and make <b>SURE</b> that the colors are supported</strong><p>
<p><strong>This fork is probably the most updated version you'll find available, please note that it's compiled against sm-1.8 and only works on sm-1.8+</strong><p>
<p>The original developer(s) quit their work, the latest (Jonitaikaponi) has gone as far as deleting the repo. I (Nikooo777) will try to keep it going</p>
